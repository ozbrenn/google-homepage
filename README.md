# google-homepage

This is part of The Odin Project course. I did the best I could to replicate the Google homepage.

My main struggle was (and still is) getting everything aligned properly; I am not entirely sure when to use flexbox and when not too.
Also, it is only half-responsive (barely). For example, the footer overlaps everything when resized to a small enough window.

In future projects I will make sure to improve my flexbox skills and learn how to properly center everything.
